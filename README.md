# Float

A library for working with floats. This can help other add-on creators to save some work.

**Functions included:**

* **Float.seemsCloseBy**: checks if two floats are close by. This can be used as an alternative for an equality check because it seems that the accuracy of float calculation results can vary.

## How to use

Please see "[How to use Library](https://github.com/SanjoSolutions/LuaLibrary#how-to-use)" for how to use this library.
